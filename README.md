# Salary_Prediction_Model-PROJ1-AnyoneAI
This is a project part of the Anyone AI program, where are being developing knowledge and hard skills in machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence.

Goal: predict salary level of sports players based on historical data of them / Also predict the ALL-NBA team in one season

Data was collected and analyzed via an API. Also was cleaned up and ordered, new fields were generated, and a base dataset was stored and created. Data manipulation and visualization was performed, as well as feature engineering and standardization. Finally, evaluation metrics and baseline models were selected, and a linear regression model was trained. Also was trained a classification model to predict the ALL-NBA team in one season, achieving a F1 score of +71%.

Two notebooks was develop in this project, the first one about data analytics, and the second one about machine learning.
