A rookie contract value depends on the draft position. (Undrafted players have to negotiate a salary independently)\n","- Performance in statistical categories: after the rookie contract, players can negotiate freely with teams, and usually statistical categories like points, rebounds and assists are extremely important.  \n","- Team: Even though there are limits to what all teams can expend in players salary, they all allocate their resources differently, and can be more willing to pay the penalties incurred by exceeding those limitations.\n","- Year in which the contract was signed: the mininum and maximum values of contracts possibles in the NBA changes depending on league revenue (television contracts, sponsorships, etc), so if the amount of money the teams make increases, players can negotiate bigger contracts.\n","- Intangibles: players can be valued also in things that are not easily translated to a statistic, good defensive players might not always have great stats but can be extremely important for a team, the same can be said about veteran players that help young ones to learn and are good locker-room guys.\n","\n","But we're going to take a simplified approach, we'll try to use the data we already have to make the best estimator possible, and then we will analyze what went right and what could've gone wrong with our results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6f110fec-8919-4427-89f7-b3e581176703","metadata":{"id":"6f110fec-8919-4427-89f7-b3e581176703"},"source":["### Analyzing our data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bdac389b-e5f8-4563-a187-36b016c0641c","metadata":{"id":"bdac389b-e5f8-4563-a187-36b016c0641c"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","data = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyoneai/notebooks/main/datasets/project2_players_df.csv\")\n","data.dropna(subset=[\"PTS\"], inplace=True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.metrics import precision_score\n","from sklearn.metrics import recall_score\n","from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n","\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"],"metadata":{"id":"yfsy4JcZoda4"},"id":"yfsy4JcZoda4","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c3cc6b89-e698-4943-8562-160190b9cbd0","metadata":{"id":"c3cc6b89-e698-4943-8562-160190b9cbd0"},"source":["Let's have another look at our previously generated dataset.

However, we can also note that there is a slight tendency to a better LINEAR correlation for the case of points vs. the salary, since we can see in the graph that, although it is true that the dispersion as we move away from the origin is greater, it tends to have a positive trend and correlation (compared with the linear regression that was graphed). For that reason, we could deduce, base in this regression, that the POINT statistics is the one that can contribute the most in predicting the salary of an NBA player. Having said that, we can continue to develop the model to make it more accuracy (because we can notice, that the linear correlation makes some negative salaries for players that have minimum points in their statistics). About the other statistics (STL and BLK), we have a very strong dispersion, so it would be hard to use those statistics individually to model a prediction of the salary.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Bu2wv04wo6tQ"},"id":"Bu2wv04wo6tQ"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"17735366-22bf-4cd8-a392-9dfb01652da0","metadata":{"id":"17735366-22bf-4cd8-a392-9dfb01652da0"},"source":["### Splitting the Dataset"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"02450fb0-829c-420b-b65c-ea553a9a81a2","metadata":{"id":"02450fb0-829c-420b-b65c-ea553a9a81a2"},"source":["1.3.

However, we must also point out that the list of players selected from our predictive model was more than 15 (a total of 27 players selected by our algorithm). This could be because we do not say at any moment to our model to pick only 15 players, and what our model did, based on the training data, is to give us an approximate number of players selected for the all-NBA team based on the past statistics, where for example, there were more teams, and therefore more players per season, than those that currently exist. Despite this, our model is not bad, since it selects 27 players (where we actually find the 15 real selected players) from a universe of 530 players, giving us a well-defined previous selection, from which we can continue modeling to get the final 15 players according to our models, and thereby evaluate the real final list of selected players versus the predicted final list of selected players.\n","Finally on this part, it is important to mention that, besides our precision metric go down in comparison to the metric from our train data, if we focus in evaluate our model primarily using the F1 Score metric, we appreciate that improves this time, and also we were able to avoid models that have very low recall.

Fortunately we have the stratify parameter as a good strategy to deal with this inbalance. Nevertheless, when we train our model, based on the statistics of each player during the season, we are not modeling the human component of the selection decision of the all-NBA team players, since ultimately the decision is not necessarily based on statistics, and it ends up being a personal decision by a global panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. Therefore, in my opinion, that would be one of the biggest modeling challenges to develop a more accurate prediction.
